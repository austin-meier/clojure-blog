<h1>Post 1</h1><p>This is my first markdown post to see if I am able to parse it.</p><ul><li>This is a list item</li><li>Here is another list item</li></ul><hr /><h1>Creating this blog</h1><p><p style="color: #676767;">April 9th, 2023</p></p><h2>The Process</h2><p>In an attempt to build something actually useful with Clojure I am created a blog! The Clojure project is static website blog generator that will parse markdown files in a directory and convert them to HTML. </p><h2>Some issues encountered along the way</h2><h3>1) Dependencies</h3><p>I feel I am not sure quite how dependencies work and how I can navigate them without just strictly looking at what the github tells me. For instance markdown-clj is on clojars as just that <code>markdown-clj</code> but you pull it in as <code>markdown.core</code>. I feel like I do remember getting to something one time that showed me like all the current "environment" items available in the REPL/project. But I didn't get much feedback from leinigen after adding markdown-clj to the :dependencies list. I ended up running <code>lein deps</code> and I think that helped but I kinda was taking shots in the dark for a little moment.</p><h3>2) Date sorting the posts</h3><p>This ended up being a lot more thought provoking of an issue then I originally thought it would be. I needed to sort my blog posts by date to build them in the correct order. I first tried to see if I could use some file metadata but honestly decided to go the more simple route of dedicating the first line of the blog post to a timestamp and just parsing it as such and sorting the posts by them.</p><p>The issue with this then became finding a good way to parse the first line in to the keyword of a map and then the rest of the lines into a another keyword of the map. I ended up using the BufferedReader of Java with io/reader and line-seq but this gives a lazy sequence so I think I had to realize the sequence with vector before doing this. This also made it so I had to then string/join the rest of the vector which sort of feels inefficient to parse the whole thing in to a vector and then join it back to as string but I am not sure if there is a better way to go about this.</p><h3>3) I don't actually know markdown well</h3><p>There seems to be like different versions of it. I only really have experience with GitHub markdown. Thankfully this appears to support HTML so that is a big plus. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565694425674678273/1010803488269287424/IMG_3574.jpg"  width="20%" height="20%"></p><h3>4) How to blog?</h3><ul><li>???</li><li>???</li></ul><hr /><h1>Older post</h1><p>Please place this last</p><hr /><h1>Even older post</h1><p>This thing better be dead last</p><ul><li>list item 1</li><li>list item 2</li></ul>    </body>
